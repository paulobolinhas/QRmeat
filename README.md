There is a particular emphasis on solving complex problems and exploring creative solutions. The adopted approach emphasizes reflection-in-action, using techniques for data gathering in the field, from primary sources, and techniques for active solution exploration, which are supported by prototyping tools. Several design artifacts are generated: problem and solution frameworks, empathy and affinity maps, wireframes, storyboards, and project canvas.
